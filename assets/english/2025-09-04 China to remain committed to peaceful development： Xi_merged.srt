00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Now the news, An Do Hong Yu.

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:16,839
Chinese President Xi Jinping says the country will remain committed to the path of peaceful development and work with all people around the world in building a community with a shared future for humanity.

3
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:29,400
He made the remarks in his speech and a grand gathering in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.

4
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:41,239
Xi warned that humanity today again has to choose between peace and war, dialogue and confrontation, win-win cooperation, and zero-sum game.

5
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:51,679
History cautions us that humanity rises and falls together.

6
00:00:51,679 --> 00:01:10,439
Only when all countries and nations treat each other as equals, coexist in peace and support each other can we uphold common security, eradicate the root cause of war, and prevent the reoccurrence of historical tragedies.

7
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:23,280
The grand gathering includes a military parade featuring 45 formations and aerial echelons, and showcasing both traditional battle forces and new domain forces with new combat capabilities.

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
President Xi has reviewed the troops during the parade.

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:36,880
And the invitation of the Chinese president, leaders of multiple countries, including Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, are also attending the gathering.

10
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:46,120
China's war of resistance, fought from 1931 to 1945, was among the longest and bloodiest chapters of World War II.

11
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:59,240
China and Russia have signed more than 20 cooperation agreements in areas including energy, aerospace, and artificial intelligence, as President Xi Jinping held talks with President Vladimir Putin in Beijing.

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:14,040
The Russian leader is in China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit and commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.

13
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:21,919

14
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:32,639
In his separate talks with Mongolian president, Ufna Hurasukh, Xi Jinping called on both sides to take the building of a community with a shared future as the guiding principle.

15
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,919

Chairman Wang Huning of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee attended a symposium in Beijing.

18
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:11,799
He stressed the importance of promoting China's national spirit and the spirit of resistance and working together to advance Chinese modernization and realize national rejuvenation.

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,039
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is entering the decisive stage of the war in Gaza.

20
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:28,919
He made the announcement as he was seeking to rally support among reservists and counter reports of low turnout for the latest call-up.

21
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,719
Netanyahu said the military campaign has advanced Israel toward a sweeping victory.

22
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:45,200
Israel has summoned about 40,000 reservists as part of its plan to capture Gaza City, the largest single call-up since the war began nearly two years ago.

23
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,080
But media reports said the turnout was lower than expected.

24
00:03:49,080 --> 00:04:03,719
Over 350 reservists also announced in a letter that they will refuse to serve if ordered into Gaza, denouncing the government's decision to take over Gaza City as reckless and vowing not to take part.

25
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,360
Banned weather and infrastructure are hampering rescue efforts in western Sudan following a landslide.

26

28
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,920
The brigade said in a statement that a suicide tanker detonated himself inside a car in front of the headquarters.

29
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,480
It said the situation is under control and that the headquarters continues to perform its duties.

30
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
And that's the news.

31
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm Do Hongyu.

32
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
