Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi says the friendship between China and Hungary sets an example for China and Europe to enhance mutual trust and expand cooperation.

14
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:53,179

Siatou said Hungary looks forward to further deepening relations with China.

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:31,480

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Siatou also said his country is willing to play a constructive role in promoting the development of Europe-China ties.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Hamas' statement as a spin.

27
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:54,959
