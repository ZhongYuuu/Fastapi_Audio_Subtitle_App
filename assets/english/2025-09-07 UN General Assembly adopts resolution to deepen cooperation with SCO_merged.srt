US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War. That was the title it held until after World War II when officials sought to emphasize the Pentagon's role in preventing conflict. A White House fact sheet shows that the order will authorize Defense Secretary Pete Hexeth and subordinate officials to use secondary titles such as Secretary of War in official correspondence. Nick Harper reports from Washington.

Importantly for the US president, he's looking at what it was called during the first and second world war and it was still called the Department of War then. He has said that the US had an unbelievable history of victory when it was called the Department of War. So partly due to that nostalgia but I think also partly due to the desire amongst the Trump administration to shake things up. Russian President Vladimir Putin says any western troops deployed to Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets for the Russian military. He said there will be no sense in foreign troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached. French President Emmanuel Macron said 26 plesh to provide Ukraine with post-war security guarantees. Those include deploying an international force on land, sea and in the air. Hungary is accusing some European Union member states of secretly purchasing Russian oil. Foreign Minister Peter Seattle said Hungary openly buys oil from Russia because it has no alternatives while some other European countries are importing the same crude through intermediaries at lower prices. He noted that the European Union had declined Budapest request to expand pipeline capacities while Hungary's southern neighbor Croatia increased transit fees. US President Donald Trump recently called for European nations to stop importing Russian oil. The World Health Organization says the spread of MPox in Africa no longer represents a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director General Tejris Atnam Gebreyes said the decision is based on sustained declines in cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in other affected countries including Burundi and Sierra Leone. The health body stated that lifting the emergency declaration does not mean the threat is over and MPox remains a continental emergency. More than 100 countries worldwide have reported cases since May 2022. FIFA has named Chinese player Sun Jihai one of the 16 members of its players voice panel. It aims to step up the fight against racism in football. FIFA said the panel advocates for cultural change and the consistent implementation of anti-racism measures. Other panelists include George Wehr, Didier Drogba and Blaise Matuidi. The world football's governing body said the panel is the result of a unanimous vote by all 211 FIFA member associations.
