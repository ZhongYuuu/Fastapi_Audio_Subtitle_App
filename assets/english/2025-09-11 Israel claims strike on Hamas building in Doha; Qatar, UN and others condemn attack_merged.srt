All of the top Hamas officials and mediators were there. Some reports are saying everybody was killed. Other reports are saying no one was injured. After the killing of Ismail Aniyah last year in Tehran and the Hamas officials which were killed in Beirut, there are only two remaining safe places for the Hamas officials. One is Turkey, the other is Qatar. So far Israel refrained from doing any offensive operation in Qatar due to the role that it has in the mediation.
