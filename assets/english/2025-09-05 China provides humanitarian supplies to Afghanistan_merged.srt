Among them, I think the Global Governance Initiative proposed by China is timely and significant. It aims to strengthen cooperation of Shanghai Cooperation Organization member countries, as well as cooperation with potential partners. Putin took part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Tianjin and China's Victory Day commemorations in Beijing.

Paulo Cabral reports from Sao Paulo. At the end of this trial, former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven other defendants could face prison sentences of more than 40 years. They stand accused of attempting a coup d'etat and several associated crimes, judging them a panel of five Supreme Court justices. The first to speak was Alexandre de Morais, the judge who's led the case and now has to present a report to his peers. It is a highly divisive case in a country already marked by polarization and one with international repercussions. The former president is under house arrest wearing an ankle monitor, a measure imposed by Morais that has outraged Bolsonaro supporters. Cambodian officials say the country attracted fixed asset investment of $7.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first eight months of the year. The figure represents an increase of 50% from a year earlier. FIFA says it'll use dynamic pricing for the first phase of 2026 World Cup ticket sales with seats starting at $60 U.S. dollars and prices varying by demand, topping over $6,000 for later rounds.
