00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
Now, the news.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,080
I'm Wen Jie.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:13,480
Chinese Premier Li Zhang has expressed the country's readiness to strengthen high-level exchanges and strategic communication with North Korea.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,559
He met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang on Thursday.

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:29,079
Premier Li said the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have always regarded ties with North Korea from a strategic height and a long-term perspective.

6
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:39,079
He also said maintaining, consolidating and developing traditional-friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries is China's unwavering policy.

7
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:50,959
Kim said Pyongyang is willing to maintain close high-level exchanges with Beijing, promote cooperation in various fields, and strengthen multilateral collaboration.

8
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:56,719
Italian President Sergio Madarella has met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Rome.

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,679
Madarella described both nations as ancient civilizations that embrace peace and cooperation.

10
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:13,599
He also highlighted China's increasingly crucial role in the international community, saying Italy expects China to make greater contributions to global peace and stability.

11
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:29,000
Wang said China values Italy's influence in Europe and the world, and he called for joint efforts to implement the consensus reached by the two countries' leaders, consolidate partnership and make bilateral relations more stable and resilient.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,799
Hamas says it has received guarantees from mediators and the U.S. government confirming the complete end of the war in the Gaza Strip.

13
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:47,718
The head of the Hamas negotiating delegation says the guarantees paved the way for the implementation of the first phase of the U.S. plan for a permanent ceasefire.

14
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:57,560
Khalil Al-Hayya reaffirms Hamas' approval of the agreement reached during the three-day negotiations held in the Egyptian resort city of Shamil Sheikh.

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:11,000
He says the agreement includes a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, the entry of humanitarian aid, the reopening of the Rafa crossing in both directions and a prisoner swap.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,639
Meanwhile, the Israeli government has approved the Gaza ceasefire deal in exchange for the release of all hostages.

17
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,840
Adele Marouki reports.

18
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,120
What comes after the first phase is the most crucial part.

19
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
It is the reason why all previous ceasefire agreements have collapsed.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,598
That is the management of Gaza.

21
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:30,718
Who will take over Gaza?

22
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:39,280
This armament of the Palestinian armed resistance group, which they said they will not do before establishing an independent Palestinian state.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,438
Israel also objects to any government in Gaza that involves Hamas or the Palestinian authorities.

24
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:57,759
So there's a lot of reform that has to be done within the Palestinian front so that they can start sending some assurances to Israel that no further attacks will come from this part of the occupied territories towards them.

25
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:09,159
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the world body is ready to scale up humanitarian relief to Gazans following the announcement of a ceasefire deal.

26
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:17,840
Guterres said the UN has the expertise, the distribution networks and community relationships in place to act.

27
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,280
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will pay compensation over the crash of an Azerbaijani passenger jet in December.

28
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,840
Putin discussed the causes of the accident with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev during their meeting in Dushanbe.

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:45,000
He said Russia was tracking three Ukrainian drones crossing its border then, and technical malfunctions of Russia's air defense system may have been a factor in the crash.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,280
The Kremlin says there has been no substantive response from Washington to Russia's initiative on the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

31
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,758
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says there is a serious pause in the dialogue process between Russia and the United States.

32
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:11,120
Commenting on the Ukraine conflict, Peskov says Kiev is not at all drawn to any kind of peace process right now.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,959
Not-going French Prime Minister Sebastian Lacourneau says parliament could eventually reach a deal on a 2026 budget.

34
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,720
On Monday, Lacourneau resigned after less than four weeks on the job.

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:34,079
However, a French President Emmanuel Macron's request, Lacourneau is holding last-stage consultations with key political party leaders.

36
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,079
And that's the news.

37
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,079
I'm Wenzhi.
