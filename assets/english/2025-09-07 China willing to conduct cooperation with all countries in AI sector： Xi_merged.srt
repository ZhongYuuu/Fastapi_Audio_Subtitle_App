10

The district's attorney general said such deployment is unlawful and that the forced military occupation of the District of Columbia violates local autonomy and basic freedoms, which must end.

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:08,140
The attorney general's office said the deployment violates the Home Rule Act, which grants a local government the authority to govern itself, exercising powers of governance within its own administrative area.

21
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:22,659
The lawsuit was filed less than a month after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on deploying the National Guard to the US capital to help restore law and order and ensure public safety.

26
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:11,620

27
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,779
A Kremlin spokesperson said foreign military units cannot provide security guarantees to Ukraine.

28
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:28,819
