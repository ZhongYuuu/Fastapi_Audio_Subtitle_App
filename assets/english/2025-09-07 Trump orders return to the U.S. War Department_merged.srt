1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Now the news, I'm Tianyu.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,839
U.S. President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:20,559
That was the title it held until after World War II when officials sought to emphasize the Pentagon's role in preventing conflict.

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:29,000
Trump has also challenged conventional norms over domestic deployment of military, deploying troops in cities like Los Angeles and Washington.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,640
A White House fact sheet shows that the order will authorize Defense Secretary Pete Hexeth and subordinate officials to use secondary titles such as Secretary of War in official correspondence.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,840
Nick Harper reports from Washington.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,400
The U.S. president still needs Congress to approve this name change.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:56,719
But importantly for the U.S. president, he's looking at what it was called during the First and Second World War and it was still called the Department of War then.

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,600
He has said that the U.S. had an unbelievable history of victory when it was called the Department of War.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,920
So partly due to that nostalgia but I think also partly due to the desire amongst the Trump administration to shake things up.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,560
Official data shows that China's service trade posted solid growth in the first seven months of 2025.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,680
The Commerce Ministry says the country saw a steep increase in the trade of travel-related services.

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,840
The volume of trading services reached nearly 4.6 trillion yuan or over 644 billion U.S.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,760
dollars between January and July and an increase of 8.2%.

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:48,400
Russian President Vladimir Putin had said the country will roll out a visa-free policy for Chinese citizens to reciprocate a similar policy from China.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,280
The president was speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia's Far East.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Putin said the policy reflects friendship between the two countries and it will further promote people-to-people exchanges and facilitate business and trade activities.

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,639
China has rolled out a one-year visa-free policy for Russian citizens with ordinary passports.

19
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,840
The policy takes effect from September 15.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:24,159
The Chinese embassy in Afghanistan has handed over 200,000 U.S. dollars in emergency humanitarian cash assistance to support Afghanistan's earthquake relief efforts.

21
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,840
The Red Cross Society of China provided the assistance.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,239
The handover took place during a meeting between a senior diplomat from the Chinese embassy and the president of the Afghan Red Crescent Society.

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:46,000
Earlier, the Chinese government said it will provide 50 million yuan or roughly 7 million U.S. dollars in emergency humanitarian aid for quick-hit Afghanistan.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,560
According to the Afghan Red Crescent Society, the powerful quick has killed more than 2,200 people and injured more than 3,600 others.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,639
The British government has appointed David Lamy, deputy prime minister, following the resignation of Angela Reiner.

26
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,400
He will also serve as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for justice.

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,080
Yavit Cooper will succeed Lamy as foreign secretary.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:22,960
The reshuffle came after revelations that Reiner failed to pay 40,000 pounds or nearly 5,400 U.S. dollars in stamp duty on a second home.

29
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:34,240
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that 26 countries, mostly from Europe, have formally vowed to deploy troops as part of a future Russian-Ukrainian ceasefire.

30
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,000
The announcement followed a virtual meeting of the Coalition of the Willing co-chaired by Macron and British Prime Minister Kirstjen Stammer.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,319
Macron said the countries will contribute to a reassurance force that could deploy troops in Ukraine to provide support.

32
00:03:49,319 --> 00:04:00,080
He also said the participants have held a call with U.S. President Donald Trump and the U.S. is set to finalize its contributions to the security guarantees in the coming days.

33
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,360
The World Health Organization says the spread of MPOCs in Africa no longer represents a public health emergency of international concern.

34
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:23,280
WHO Director General Tejriz Atnam-Gabrielsis said the decision is based on sustained declines in cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in other affected countries, including Burundi and Sierra Leone.

35
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,920
The health body stated that lifting the emergency declaration does not mean the threat is over and MPOCs remains a continental emergency.

36
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,439
More than 100 countries worldwide have reported cases since May 2022.

37
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,600
That's the news.

38
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm Ken You.
