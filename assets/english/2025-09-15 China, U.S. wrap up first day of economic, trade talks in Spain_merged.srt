Hamats says it has suspended talks on the prisoner swap with Israel after recusing Israel of targeting its negotiating delegation in Qatar last week. A senior Hamats official said negotiations cannot continue if the delegation responsible for them is attacked inside a country acting as mediator. He accused the Israeli Prime Minister of obstructing efforts to reach a ceasefire and a prisoner exchange. He also warned that intensified Israeli strikes on residential towers in Gaza could endanger Israeli captives. The official also dismissed the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit to Israel, seeing Hamats expected no change in Israel's position. Israeli airstrikes have levelled residential buildings in Gaza City in recent days, killing dozens.
