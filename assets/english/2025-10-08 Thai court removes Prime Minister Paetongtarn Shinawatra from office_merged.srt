Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Xiaoshu has called for strengthening the role of the United Nations, saying reforms are needed to help the world body tackle global challenges.

5
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:39,421
He says the UN's effectiveness depends on member states upholding the UN Charter and observing international law and the basic norms governing international relations.

6
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:46,736
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory of World War II and also the founding of the UN, the direct outcome of the war.

7
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:56,489
Meanwhile, the Chinese diplomat says the country has taken the lead in practicing true multilateralism and it firmly supports the UN in playing a central role in international affairs.

The Vice Foreign Minister says China's committed to peaceful development.

9
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:09,083
Ma also says a community with a shared future for humanity offers new wisdom to global governance and it presents a new vision for a better world.

Vice Foreign Minister Ma Xiaoshu has briefed the media about China's commitment to uphold peaceful development.

12
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:28,204
In terms of building a community of shared future for humanity, he highlighted that at this critical historical juncture, this concept has charted the course for global peace and development.

13
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,567
What began as a China initiative has now evolved into a global consensus.

14
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:43,323
He elaborated that for eight consecutive years, this concept is included in the UN General Assembly resolutions as well as the declarations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

15
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:49,716
And the concept also consistently incorporated in the declarations of BRICS leaders meeting for eight times.

16
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:54,079
And it also brings new wisdom and new vision for building a better world.

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,309
China Coast Guard's conducted law enforcement patrols in the territorial waters of Huangyangdao and other nearby islands.

18
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:07,344
The CCG said it stepped up its presence around the islands in the South China Sea since early August.

19
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:11,348
It said it's carrying up patrols in line with laws and regulations.

20
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:24,374
Thailand's constitutional courts removed suspended Prime Minister Phaetongtuan Shenowat from office after finding her guilty of ethical misconduct over a controversial phone call with former Cambodian leader, Hoon Sen.

21
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:31,366
In the leaked call, Phaetongtuan was heard discussing the Thailand-Cambodia border crisis with Hoon Sen back in June.

22
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:38,297
She also described the Thai military as the opposite side and blamed them for escalating tensions across the border.

23
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:45,169
The ruling on Friday made Phaetongtuan the fifth Prime Minister since 2008 to be stripped of office by Thai judges.

24
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,798
Chao Rat-Yong Jirenon has more from Bangkok.

25
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:59,370
We have another dismissed Prime Minister here in the country, Phaetongtuan Shenowat, has been found guilty of not meeting the ethical standards of her position as Prime Minister.

26
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:09,057
What we know so far in terms of the announcement made by the constitutional court is that they had defined the ethical standards of a Prime Minister.

27
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:17,639
They said that what the actions that she had taken was reflecting the lack of unity between the government and military at the time.

28
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:25,126
UN Secretary General Antony Guterres has urged Israel to ensure an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

29
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:31,409
He also called for unobstructed humanitarian access into Gaza and unconditional release of hostages.

30
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:40,519
Guterres warned that famines aggrim reality in Gaza, saying Israel has clear obligations to provide food, water, medicine and essential supplies.

31
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:46,435
The Israeli military is in the initial stages of a new attack on Gaza City.

32
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:55,554
According to a military spokesperson, the Israeli military will intensify its strikes until it brings back all the hostages and dismantles Hamas.

33
00:03:55,554 --> 00:04:03,163
Meanwhile, a statement from the Israel Defense Forces says the daily 10-hour humanitarian pause in Gaza City is canceled.

34
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:08,257
The statement also says the city from now on constitutes a dangerous combat zone.

35
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:15,426
Britain, France and Germany have triggered a process that could reimpose full UN sanctions on Iran within 30 days.

36
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:20,834
The move is a response to what they call Tehran's violations of the 2015 nuclear deal.

37
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:24,796
Iran says the European move is illegal and a blow to diplomacy.

38
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:33,097
The US State Department confirmed the country will not participate in the United Nations periodic review of its human rights record.

39
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:37,247
The US is the first UN member state to withdraw from that process.

40
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:42,593
The review requires all 193 member states to submit reports every four to five years.

41
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:43,850
And that's the news.

42
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,920
