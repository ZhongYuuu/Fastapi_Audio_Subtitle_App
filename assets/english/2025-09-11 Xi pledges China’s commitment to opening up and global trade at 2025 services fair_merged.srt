Now, the news. I'm Tian Lu. Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent a congratulatory letter to the 2025 China International Fair for Trade in Services, stressing China's commitment to opening up and global cooperation. He said the world economy is undergoing profound changes, pledging that China will expand high-standard opening up, align with international trade rules and advance reforms in free trade pilot zones and national-level demonstration zones for the innovative development of trade in services. The president said China will continue opening its service sector in an orderly way, aiming for high-quality growth in trade in services.

He added that China is ready to work with other countries to promote open and cooperative global trade and build a community with a shared future for humanity. China's consumer inflation fell in August, while factory prices showed signs of stabilization. The consumer price index fell 0.4% year-on-year, though cool inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.9%, marking the fourth consecutive months of increase. The producer price index dropped 2.9%, narrowing its decline from July and holding steady on a monthly basis. Officials said the trends reflect the supportive macroeconomic policies and improvements across several industries.

Qatar has vowed to respond to an Israeli strike on its capital on Tuesday. Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Tani called the attack a violation of Qatar's sovereignty and said the country is forming a team to pursue legal action against Israel. The strike targeted the headquarters of Hamas in Doha, which said its negotiating delegation survived what it called an Israeli assassination attempt. Six people were killed, including members of the group's escorts, a Qatari security officer, and Hamam al-Hayyya, the son of senior Hamas official Halih al-Hayyya.

Hamas accused Israel of trying to derail ongoing mediation efforts over Gaza and call the attack an assault on Qatar's sovereignty, holding Washington jointly responsible. Israel confirmed it carried out the strikes, with officials saying the operation was independent, though a senior Israeli official claimed the U.S. President Donald Trump had approved it. The White House said Trump was informed once the operation began and immediately directed his envoy to notify Qatar.

Qatar, however, denied any prior knowledge of the attack. John Gambrough has more.

The Qataris are incredibly upset after this extraordinary attack by Israel. The United States and others had asked Qatar to be a mediator with Hamas, but now the Qataris are signaling that they're upset, but maybe that they'll go back to it, but as of right now it doesn't look like they want to. We heard tonight from their prime minister. The Israeli attack that took place is simply a clear message to the region as a whole, and this message says that there's a rogue player in this region in ongoing political recklessness that has encroached upon the sovereignty of states. Netanyahu himself has declared that he would reshape the Middle East. Does this message mean the intends to reshape the Gulf as well? The Israelis had been trying to reach out to Gulf Arab states for a while now trying to get them to have diplomatic recognition deals, but it looks like that effort to reach out is over at this point, and the ceasefire negotiations are really in question. Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency have agreed to resume cooperation. The announcement came in Cairo, where Iranian foreign ministers say the Bersarakchi deal protects Iran's sovereignty and nuclear rights. Egypt's foreign minister welcomed Tehran's willingness to return to talks and pledged to help ease regional tensions.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi confirmed that practical steps were agreed to restart inspections, calling it a step toward diplomacy and stability. Iran had suspended cooperation in June after Israeli-U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites and the killing of its scientists. Since then, Tehran required inspection requests to be cleared by its Supreme National Security Council.
