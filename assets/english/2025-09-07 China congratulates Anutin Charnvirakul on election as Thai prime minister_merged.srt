00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:53,960
We are officially now getting the votes confirmed here that the new 32nd Thai Prime Minister for the country, Anu Tin-Chuan Mirgundi, leader of Boomjai Thai Party has won the vote, 311 to the total of 490 seats here in parliament.

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:07,480
As the new Prime Minister, this is quite unprecedented because it's the first time that there is no horse trading, you could say, in politics here in Thailand and that it's going to be a minority government.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:15,359
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the country will roll out a visa-free policy for Chinese citizens to reciprocate similar policies from China.

10
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,719
The president was speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia's Far East.

11

14
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,919
Portuguese Prime Minister Luiz Montenegro will visit China from Monday to Wednesday.

15
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:44,479

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:56,920
Chinese Foreign Ministry has called for joint efforts with Portugal to promote strategic mutual trust, deepen friendly exchanges, advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and enrich their partnership.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,240
Official data shows that China's service trade posted solid growth in the first seven months of 2025.

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:19,040
The volume of trade and services reached nearly 4.6 trillion yuan, or over 644 billion US dollars between January and July, an increase of 8.2%.

The Chinese Embassy in Afghanistan handed over 200,000 US dollars in emergency humanitarian cash assistance to support Afghanistan's earthquake relief efforts.

21
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,159
The Red Cross Society of China provided the assistance.

22
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:38,319
The handover took place during a meeting between a senior diplomat from the Chinese Embassy and the president of the Afghan Red Crescent Society.

23
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:47,319
Earlier, the Chinese government said it'll provide 50 million yuan, or roughly 7 million US dollars, in emergency humanitarian aid for Quake-hit Afghanistan.

24
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:56,560
According to the Afghan Red Crescent Society, the powerful Quake has killed more than 2,200 people and injured more than 3,600 others.

27
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:20,599
The meeting in Doha came after France, Britain, and Germany moved to trigger a scheme to reinstate international sanctions on Iran.

28
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:29,599
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that 26 countries, mostly from Europe, have formally vowed to deploy troops as part of a future Russian-Ukrainian ceasefire.

29
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,560
The announcement followed a virtual meeting of the coalition of the willing, co-chaired by Macron and British Prime Minister Kirsten Starrer.

30
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,800
Macron said the country is still contributing to a reassurance force that could deploy troops in Ukraine to provide support.

31
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:51,199
He also said the participants have held a call with US President Donald Trump, and the US is set to finalize its contributions to the security guarantees in the coming days.

32
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,239
Ross Cullen has more from Paris.

33
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,000
It is complicated because the European allies of Ukraine do see it as crucial.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,840
It is also something that Volodymyr Zelensky has said himself.

35
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
There has to be US backstop.

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,240
There has to be US participation in the security guarantees involvement in the design in the architecture of those security guarantees.

37
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,560
There has been wavering signals from the US.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,959
We heard Donald Trump saying he wasn't ruling out US boots on the ground.

39
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
Then he was ruling it out.

40
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:26,319
He was saying there could be air support without defining if that would be jets and bombers or if that would simply be air defense systems.

41
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,199
British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Reiner has reportedly resigned following a property tax scandal.

42
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,680
Reiner, who also served as housing secretary, stepped down after failing to pay Â£40,000 in stamp duty on her second home.

43
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,959
And that's the news.

44
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm Shane Degas.

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
